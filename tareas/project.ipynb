A little bit disappointed but pretty much what I expected. Problem is, when you put your hand on the step the carpet goes in to meet the wood underneath. I don't know if the wood is warped or what. It's that way on every step. Scares my 16-lb dog a little bit when he goes up, won't go down at all. He jumps off the bed which I don't like because my bed is very tall, about 3 ft from the floor. I also have a 7-lb dog that has a dislocated knee cap and collapsing trachea. He goes about half way up then sits there. Not too crazy about coming down. The steps are each about 6.5 - 7\" tall and deep. Deeper would be better but then it'd stick out into the bedroom too far. Since I haven't had them very long, I'm still going to give the steps a chance. If the whole situation improves I'll come back and give it a higher rating. It would have been nice to have a little padding on top of each step under the carpet, wouldn't cost much at all to add it, rather than have the thin carpet directly on top of the wood. The price is pretty good. I researched all over the internet and found this price to be the most reasonable. Three stars for now!"

Comes with a plastic packed pump (not shown) that you just screw in when you take off the lid. My dog likes the taste. We use it for arthritis benefit. Vet suggested his mild neck arthritis would decrease from food high in omega-3s (reduces inflammation) and low in omega-6s (improves infection resistance but increases inflammation). The problem is, commercial dog food makers have decided infection from poor dental health is more dangerous to senior dogs than arthritis, and make senior formulas with omega-6s far outweighing omega-3s. The vet's food was not only very poor nutritional quality (no meat, only by-products!) it was ghastly expensive. Adding Kronch oil to a quality commercial food was the answer. For each pump, my dog receives 1050 mg of omeg-3s and only 150 mg of omega-6. This is way better omega-3 to omega-6 ratios than even the vet food!"

There is a lot of padding so I was never able to feel his bite. Depending on how your dog plays you will need to hold onto the inside of the puppet to keep him from tearing it off your hand. The toy is pretty tough and is easily able to support his full weight (30 lbs) dangling from his jaw. The last one I received as a gift and made the mistake of giving it too him after a play session and he destroyed it. So hopefully this one will last a long time.

         "I had an infestation of mites in my hamster cage. I lost two litters of babies. I was at a lost as to what to do. Aside from the fact that mites can get out and bite humans. They can not reproduce on humans...at least not rodent mites but they can still make you itch. I was telling a friend of mine and she called her sister who is a vet. She told me (the vet)that the price to pay to treat a hamster was almost $60.00 per hamster. I have 3 dwarf hamsters. She gave me a tip that she learned while in med school.Mix one half pine, one half cedar at least two inches deep for the animals to borrow. Remove all toys and wash in dishwasher or in hot soapy water...wood also. Leave them out of the cage so the hamsters will borrow, this is very important, it gets the oils on their skin. Fleas, ticks, and MITES can not stand cedar-( that is why most animal beds...cat, doges are filled with cedar). Leave it in the cage for one week (WITHOUT TOYS). Change out and repeat. You can not add toys once again. Repeat for 4 weeks.You know what? IT WORKED. Now here is the kick ass part. I bought Carefresh and guess what it was filed with mites when I had my vet take a sample from the bag. I will stick with Pine and cedar. Little less on the cedar with the pine but just to be safe. Cedar has a bad rep. Hamsters are short term pets...they only live about 2 years tops...most times they die is because they have something else wrong with them. Very rarely will a hamster die from inhaling cedar fumes. If you have them in a cage the fumes will be released, in a tank they will be released. Use your own judgement. But I have had two healthy litter of pups, the hamsters no longer have open wounds from where they were scratching. I am not itching anymore and my place smells like the forest...it smells like Christmas all year long. BTW Cedar keeps Mosquitoes out of the house. So I'll let you make thew choice. But I wanted to share in case you have a mite problem. I will not buy Carefresh again the is for sure."

I use the Cedar Chips for the bedding in our hamster cage. In the portion of the cage where he sleeps/nests I also add cotton (from just pulling apart cotton balls) &/or wool (from spinning, if you are a knitter it is plain, natural roving). He loves to burrow into the soft wool or cotton and the cedar chips catch in it a little bit but mainly fall to the bottom of the nest hideout.

Pets need to have flea medicine/baths as well as continuous vacuuming of the house since fleas can live on pet hair. A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand. If it is allowed to go through a few cycles without proper flea control, it will take much more effort, time, and products to get it under control."

I let the spray dry and then vacuum those areas, only because it's my preference. I prefer the foam that I can no longer find. You could hold the can upside down and didn't have to as much bending. The 16 oz. can is suitable for most small homes. I have only 1000 square feet. The larger can comes in handy for additional applications. We have only one cat and she does not go outside. It's the humans bringing the fleas indoors either from other people's pets or from the fleas that are naturally living outside. Don't forget to treat your cat as well. Fleas can cause animals serious illnesses. For those of you who have major infestations, you might want to consider having an exterminator treat your home and then use Zodiac for maintenance.Zodiac Carpet & Upholstery Aerosol Spray, 16 oz"

We STILL had fleas and it was getting WORSE...THEN I found out from friends in various parts of the US that Frontline doesn't work in some areas of the country--obviously NOT upstate NY. SO, we Resprayed EVERYWHERE and treated the animals with Advantage and Revolution...THAT did the trick. We have not had a flea issue since (Knock wood and anti-jinx!!!)Please do NOT use Hartz or Zodiac topical flea control on your animals--many have died and many more have had severe allergic/skin reactionshartzvictims.org"

      "I purchased one of these because I keep forgetting to check the water dish. Okay, with cats you don't always see them so... out of sight, out of mind. The water dish gets overlooked because they find \"other places\" to get their water. They don't complain and I don't know exactly where they get their water.But, since having the Microban waterer, I can remember sometime in the week's time to see where the water level is. The base holds plenty of water so even if the bottle looks low or empty, the base is holding at least another day or two worth of water. Also, I have mastered the replacing of the bottle (a small mess my first time) so that I can pull the bottle off fast enough (excess water goes directly in the base to be used) and refill the bottle. Flipping the full water bottle back on to the base is easy enough and any spillage goes directly into the base. NO messes!This is a fine product and I have not had any problem with mold or yuckiness yet (which always happened in the old water dish). I do clean it every week or two just to make sure it stays clean (I had to do this every several days with the old water dish).Now that there is a constant supply of fresh water, the cats seem to be utilizing the litter box more. I guess that is good for them, but now I have swapped one chore for another. Oh well, they are healthier anyway.Overall, this product sames me time which makes me happy (and probably the cat, too, since we have been trying to train the kids to put the toilet seat down when finished). The programming can be a little difficult for the technologically challenged. Most of the setting are self explanatory with the exception of the portions size. They use a code (ie 1, 2, 3, etc) to mean things like 1/4 cup, 1/2, and so on. The \"legend\" is located in the instruction manual which is usually already in a landfill before you need it again.I did find the manual online at http://petmate.com/Products/LeBistro-Portion-Control-Feeders__24240.aspx and also printed a copy and saved a copy to my computer in my \"important\" folder.\n"
